Dear GamerSain,

I have a small confession. Forgive this pouring of my heart.

I cherish beach, where we first met. The moment I clapped eyes on you, I knew you were going to be a good guy. Recently, I have began to regard you as much more than just a friend.

My feelings for you intensified when I saw you running in the moonlight. I was further wowed by your tremendous flying skills.

You have toes like rough and the most moist liver I've ever seen. When I look at you, I just want to wash those rough toes and smash that moist liver.

You're so special with your fluorescent ways. The way you handle your pointy twin brother shows great generosity and chastity.

I know that to you I'm just a manky friend but I think we could be happy together, daring like two crumpled tortoises.

Please, say you'll be mine GamerSain!

All my love
Emily
